AdBlock list for sites which don't play the game (intrusive pop-up ads...).

Don't hesitate to contribute and add other sites which don't respect you !

# Why

In my opinion, AdBlock (Edge) should always be disabled except for sites which don't play the game.

# How to

If you just want to block evil sites :

 * Click on AdBlock (Edge) icon
 * Uncheck "always disable" 
 * Go to the preference filters window
 * Uncheck all previous subscriptions list
 * Add another list : https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chocobozzz/adblock-mf-list/master/list.txt 
 * Enjoy, you're a good person :)
